# KeyLogger
This java based application implements a basic keylogger which keeps a track of all the keys pressed along with their date and time of pressing.
The tracked information is stored in the form of a text file residing in local environment.

**Note:** To begin spying on your friend or child or partner (:wink:), edit the Confif.Properties file and add the path to the location you want the information to be stored.

Happy Spying!
